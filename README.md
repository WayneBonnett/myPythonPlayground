**Oh Python, my dear serpentine friend,** <br>
With your code, my woes you always mend. <br>
Your syntax is clean, so easy to read, <br>
In the world of coding, you take the lead. <br>

Indentations? No worries, I’m a pro, <br>
No more braces, semicolons, just go! <br>
Lists and tuples, dictionaries too, <br>
You make it all fun, like a coding zoo. <br>

From pandas to Django, your packages thrive, <br>
With NumPy and SciPy, data comes alive. <br>
Whether I’m building a website or AI, <br>
With Python by my side, I reach for the sky. <br>

You slither through code with grace and ease, <br>
Even beginners handle you with peace. <br>
Your power’s immense, yet you’re so sweet, <br>
A coding language that’s hard to beat. <br>

Oh Python, how your REPL is so grand, <br>
An interactive prompt, at my command. <br>
Print “Hello, World!” or import a module, <br>
Every session with you is a giggle and chuckle. <br>

Your PEP 8 guide is the coder's creed, <br>
Making us write in style, indeed. <br>
Whitespace is king, and lines stay neat, <br>
In Python’s kingdom, code is a treat. <br>

With every “if”, “elif”, and “else”, <br>
Your logical flow is clear as bells. <br>
And those exceptions, caught with “try”, <br>
No bugs remain hidden, they can’t even hide. <br>

Oh, the libraries, vast and profound,<br>
With each new discovery, my joy is unbound.<br>
Matplotlib, Seaborn, plotting the graphs,<br>
Turning data into visual laughs.<br>

Requests and Beautiful Soup in hand,<br>
Scraping the web, as we had planned.<br>
Automation, scraping, scripting galore,<br>
Python’s magic opens every door.<br>

Your community’s large, helpful, and wise,<br>
In forums and GitHub, where wisdom lies.<br>
Stack Overflow, our digital haven,<br>
For every question, answers are craven.<br>

In jungles of logic and forests of code,<br>
With Python, the journey’s a wonderful road.<br>
So if you see me grinning, tapping away,<br>
It’s thanks to Python, making my day!<br>

Oh Python, for you, my heart beats strong,<br>
In the world of coding, you can't go wrong.<br>
For fun or for work, we’re in great alliance,<br>
Together we’ll master the art of computer science.<br>

In this world of code, where errors can stress,<br>
Python, dear friend, you’re simply the best.<br>
So here's my ode to you, my coding delight,<br>
With Python by my side, I code day and night.<br>
<br>
