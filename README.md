Oh Python, my dear serpentine friend,
With your code, my woes you always mend.
Your syntax is clean, so easy to read,
In the world of coding, you take the lead.

Indentations? No worries, I’m a pro,
No more braces, semicolons, just go!
Lists and tuples, dictionaries too,
You make it all fun, like a coding zoo.

From pandas to Django, your packages thrive,
With NumPy and SciPy, data comes alive.
Whether I’m building a website or AI,
With Python by my side, I reach for the sky.

You slither through code with grace and ease,
Even beginners handle you with peace.
Your power’s immense, yet you’re so sweet,
A coding language that’s hard to beat.

Oh Python, how your REPL is so grand,
An interactive prompt, at my command.
Print “Hello, World!” or import a module,
Every session with you is a giggle and chuckle.

Your PEP 8 guide is the coder's creed,
Making us write in style, indeed.
Whitespace is king, and lines stay neat,
In Python’s kingdom, code is a treat.

With every “if”, “elif”, and “else”,
Your logical flow is clear as bells.
And those exceptions, caught with “try”,
No bugs remain hidden, they can’t even hide.

Oh, the libraries, vast and profound,
With each new discovery, my joy is unbound.
Matplotlib, Seaborn, plotting the graphs,
Turning data into visual laughs.

Requests and Beautiful Soup in hand,
Scraping the web, as we had planned.
Automation, scraping, scripting galore,
Python’s magic opens every door.

Your community’s large, helpful, and wise,
In forums and GitHub, where wisdom lies.
Stack Overflow, our digital haven,
For every question, answers are craven.

In jungles of logic and forests of code,
With Python, the journey’s a wonderful road.
So if you see me grinning, tapping away,
It’s thanks to Python, making my day!

Oh Python, for you, my heart beats strong,
In the world of coding, you can't go wrong.
For fun or for work, we’re in great alliance,
Together we’ll master the art of computer science.

In this world of code, where errors can stress,
Python, dear friend, you’re simply the best.
So here's my ode to you, my coding delight,
With Python by my side, I code day and night.
